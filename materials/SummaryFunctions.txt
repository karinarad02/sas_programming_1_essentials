SAS has a collection of summary functions that calculate summary statistics. Each of these functions can have an unlimited number of arguments, and each argument is either a numeric constant or numeric column in the data. The function calculates the summary statistic from the values of the arguments for each row in the data.

For these summary functions, if any of the input values are missing, the missing value or values are ignored, and the calculation is based on the known values.
